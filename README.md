# URL_Shortener
1) This project is based on the concept of URL shortener. Provide a long raw url and it will generate a short url for the particular url      which will redirect to the same given yrl.

2) The main logic behinf the project is to generate a short unique code for every long url provided and to store it in the databse. Now      the short code suffixed with some url will point to the location of the raw url.

3) I have also exposed this service to an api. Wich is in the shortener app inside the project.
